            YouTube has always been something that I wanted to be a part of. Watching creators make their own gaming videos inspired me to do the same. My journey started when I was 8 years old.

            <p>
            I had one of my friends over, and use a phone to record me play '2 Player Wizard Tycoon' on Roblox. Fortunately, I didn't upload the video. After that, I actually used screen recording and uploaded a couple videos to a now private account.
            </p>
            <p>
            This was just the beginning. Over the next few years, I had completely forgotten about making YouTube videos. It wasn't until 2021, right after COVID-19, that I decided to give it another try.

            On the 30th of January, 2021, I created my new YouTube channel, Chameleon Studios. At the time, I was really into Roblox story games, so I filmed myself playing games such as Cruise Story, Daycare Story, and the Airplane Story series.
            </p>
            <p>
            My most popular video turned out to be 'General Poncho...? | Cruise [STORY]', published on 2nd October 2021, which has 295 views as of December 2025. My latest video is 'Daycare Story 2 | Roblox', published early January 2023. And then high school started, so I abandoned the channel.

            It's mid 2024, not too long after my 13th birthday, and a thought came to me. "What if I made a YouTube channel again?" So I did. My latest channel, CamoKid, had a humble beginning on 16th June, 2024. This time, I was determined to make this channel better.
            </p>
            <p>
            I grinded Roblox videos, and it wasn't the old content I used to make. This time, I actually edited videos, tried to make them stand out, and followed the trends. Soon, my videos were gaining a couple hundred views, with my most popular video reaching over 21,000 views! I made a variety of videos, making Roblox content, Minecraft videos, and from time to time, some really cool edits.
            </p>
            <p>
            But it wouldn't be long before this channel had it's downfall as well. Just as I started making consisten long-form content, I lost my motivation. With school and extracurriculars taking up most of my time, it was difficult to balance everything. So, I decided to take a break from YouTube once again. I told myself it would be a short break, but it turned out it wouldn't be true.

            My last video was published in July-August 2025. Australia has announced the social media ban for under 16s, taking effect in early December. It meant my channel would be inactive for the next few years. I couldn't log in, nor check my videos. And with Daydream coming up in late September, I didn't have time to make videos before the ban. So I moved on.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now it's Christmas Day 2025. CamoKid will remain inactive for a while. I hope that someday I regain access to my channel, and continue making videos just like I used to.
